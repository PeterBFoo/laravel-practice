## Practice with Laravel 9

Not applying very good practices, actually trying to mess things up to discover how things are being managed.

For the views I've been using components and inheritance, did a little database scheme to keep things rolling easy, tried to do a MVC with it's controllers, service (actually like repository) and the repository... Are the models? (wtf Laravel).
Cool thing that the annotation to do the JPA thing in Laravel are the methods hasMany, belongsTo, etc... Very clear and usefull to get your scheme clear and helps you out modelling it.

Shitty project, you are welcome if you want to watch it.
